        <p>
          Hello, my name is Tyler Moore and with the help of many people I made this template.
          I made it so it is super easy to update and so that it flows perfectly with my tutorials.
          Lots of love and hundreds of hours went into making it. I hope you love it as much as I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish you the best of luck with your business, enjoy the adventure.
        </p>
